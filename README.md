# MAST90098-Assignment #
A group project, exploring heuristics for solving the Minimum Makespan 
Scheduling Problem.

## Project Organisation ##

If you just want to play around with algorithms and their parameters, 
can use runscript.m

### Local_search_heuristics ###

Contains all of the code for GLS and VDS.

### Population_based_heuristics ###

Contains all of the code for our genetic algorithm. 

### Generate_makespan_instances ###

Contains the code used to generate our test cases.

### Experiments ###

Contains code for running the algorithms on a range of test cases,
and also for tuning parameters.

### Analysis Funcs ###

Contains the code for doing analysis, also includes graphics functions.
